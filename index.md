## About Me

I am an undergraduate student in the Department of Electronic Engineering at Tsinghua University. My academic journey is deeply rooted in my passion for AI and the fascinating domain of generative models.

Currently, I am contributing as a Research Assistant at the [GeWu-Lab](https://gewu-lab.github.io/). In 2019, I was honored to receive a Bronze Medal at the National Olympiad in Informatics in China. In the summer of 2023, I furthered my practical experience in computational imaging by interning as an algorithm engineer at Xiaomi.

I am always open to communication and look forward to opportunities for collaboration in areas related to Generative AI and Computer Vision. Feel free to contact me at hplv@foxmail.com.
