## About Me

I am an undergraduate student in the Department of Electronic Engineering at Tsinghua University. My academic journey is deeply rooted in my passion for AI and the fascinating domain of generative models.

As an algorithm competitor, I won Bronze Medal at the National Olympiad in Informatics 2019 in China. During the summer of 2023, I interned as an algorithm engineer at Xiaomi, contributing to the field of computational imaging and investigating generative AI.

Currently, I am fortunate to work as a Research Assistant at [GeWu-Lab](https://gewu-lab.github.io/), advised by [Dr. Di Hu](https://dtaoo.github.io/), who is a very passionate and respectful young scholar in the field of multimodal learning.

I am always open to communication and look forward to opportunities for collaboration in areas related to Generative AI and Computer Vision. Feel free to contact me at [hplv@foxmail.com](mailto:hplv@foxmail.com).
